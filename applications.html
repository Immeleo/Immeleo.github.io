  		Networking Components
  	</h1>
  	<p>
     Computer network components are the major parts which are needed to install the software. 
      Some important network components are NIC, switch, cable, hub, router, and modem.
      Depending on the type of network that we need to install, some network components can also be removed. 
      For example, the wireless network does not require a cable.
     </p>
      <p>
       Following are the major components required to install a network:
        </p>

  	<h2>
  		NIC
  	</h2>
    <p>
      NIC stands for network interface card.
     NIC is a hardware component used to connect a computer with another computer onto a network
     It can support a transfer rate of 10,100 to 1000 Mb/s.
     The MAC address or physical address is encoded on the network card chip which is assigned by the IEEE to identify a network card uniquely.
     The MAC address is stored in the PROM (Programmable read-only memory).

    <h2>
      Hub
    </h2>
    <p>
     A Hub is a hardware device that divides the network connection among multiple devices.
     When computer requests for some information from a network, it first sends the request to the Hub through cable.
     Hub will broadcast this request to the entire network. All the devices will check whether the request belongs to them or not.
     If not, the request will be dropped.
     </p>
    <p>
    The process used by the Hub consumes more bandwidth and limits the amount of communication. 
    Nowadays, the use of hub is obsolete, and it is replaced by more advanced computer network components such as Switches, Routers.
