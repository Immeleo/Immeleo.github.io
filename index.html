  		Network Communication
  	</h1>
  	<p>
  		Network communication, or internetworking, defines a set of protocols (that is, rules and standards) that allow application
      programs to talk with each other without regard to the hardware and operating systems where they are run.
      Internetworking allows application programs to communicate independently of their physical network connections.

  		What is a Commputer network
  	</h2>
  	<p>
     A computer network comprises two or more computers that are connected—either by cables (wired) or WiFi (wireless)—with 
      the purpose of transmitting, exchanging, or sharing data and resources. You build a computer network using hardware 
      (e.g., routers, switches, access points, and cables) and software (e.g., operating systems or business applications).
  	</p>
      <p>
        Geographic location often defines a computer network. For example, a LAN (local area network) connects computers in
        a defined physical space, like an office building, whereas a WAN (wide area network) can connect computers across continents.
        The internet is the largest example of a WAN, connecting billions of computers worldwide.
