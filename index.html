  		Network Communication
  	</h1>
  	<p>
  		Network communication, or internetworking, defines a set of protocols (that is, rules and standards) that allow application
      programs to talk with each other without regard to the hardware and operating systems where they are run.
      Internetworking allows application programs to communicate independently of their physical network connections.

  		What is a Commputer network
  	</h2>
  	<p>
     A computer network comprises two or more computers that are connected—either by cables (wired) or WiFi (wireless)—with 
      the purpose of transmitting, exchanging, or sharing data and resources. You build a computer network using hardware 
      (e.g., routers, switches, access points, and cables) and software (e.g., operating systems or business applications).
  	</p>
      <p>
        Geographic location often defines a computer network. For example, a LAN (local area network) connects computers in
        a defined physical space, like an office building, whereas a WAN (wide area network) can connect computers across continents.
        The internet is the largest example of a WAN, connecting billions of computers worldwide.

  		Cryptography is the science of secret writing with the goal of hiding the meaning of a message.
      It is associated with the process of converting ordinary plain text into unintelligible text and vice-versa.
      To achieve this, cyrptography is further split into three main branches: 
  		<em>
  			Symmetric Algorithims, 
  		</em>
  		<em>
  			Asymmetric Algorithims
  		</em>
  		and
  		<em>
  			Cryptographic protocols
  		</em>
  	</p>
  	<h3>
  		Symmetric Algorithims
  	</h3>
  	<p>
  		Symmetric Algorithms are what many people assume cryptography is about:
      two parties have an encryption and decryption method for which they share a secret key.
      All cryptography from ancient times until 1976 was exclusively based on symmetric methods. 
      Symmetric ciphers are still in widespread use, especially for data encryption and integrity check of messages.
  	</p>
  		<h3>
  			Asymmetric Algorithims
  		</h3>
  		<p>
  			Asymmetric (or Public-Key) Algorithms In 1976 an entirely different type of cipher was introduced by Whitfield Diffie,
        Martin Hellman and Ralph Merkle. In public-key cryptography, a user possesses a secret key as in symmetric cryptography but also a public key.
        Asymmetric algorithms can be used for applications such as digital signatures and key establishment, and also for classical data encryption.
  		</p>
  		<h3>
  			Cryptographic protocols
  		</h3>
  		<p>
  			Cryptographic Protocols Roughly speaking, crypto protocols deal with the application of cryptographic algorithms.
        Symmetric and asymmetric algorithm can be viewed as building blocks with which applications such as secure Internet 
        communication can be realized. The Transport Layer Security (TLS) scheme, which is used in every Web browser, is an example of a cryptographic protocol.

        Qoute of the Day
        </p>

  			“here’s a toast to Alan Turing
        born in harsher, darker times
        who thought outside the container
        and loved outside the lines
        and so the code-breaker was broken
        and we’re sorry
        yes now the s-word has been spoken
        the official conscience woken
        – very carefully scripted but at least it’s not encrypted –
        and the story does suggest
        a part 2 to the Turing Test:
        1. can machines behave like humans?
        2. can we?”
       ―-- Matt Harvey
