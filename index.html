  		Cryptology
  	</h1>
  	<p>
  		Cryptology is a science concerned with data communication and storage in secure and usually secret form. It encompasess 
  		<strong>
  			Cryptography 
  		</strong> 
  		and
  		<strong>
  			Cryptanalysis
  		</strong>
  	</p>
  	<h2>
  		Cyrptanalysis
  	</h2>
  	<p>
  		Cryptanalysis is the science and sometimes art of breaking cryptosystems. You might think that code breaking is for the intelligence community or perhaps organized crime, and should not be included in a serious classification of a scientific discipline. However, most cryptanalysis is done by respectable researchers in academia nowadays. Cryptanalysis is of central importance for modern cryptosystems: without people who try to break our crypto methods, we will never know whether they are really secure or not

  		Cryptography is the science of secret writing with the goal of hiding the meaning of a message. It is associated with the process of converting ordinary plain text into unintelligible text and vice-versa. To achieve this, cyrptography is further split into three main branches: 
  		<em>
  			Symmetric Algorithims, 
  		</em>
  		<em>
  			Asymmetric Algorithims
  		</em>
  		and
  		<em>
  			Cryptographic protocols
  		</em>
  	</p>
  	<h3>
  		Symmetric Algorithims
  	</h3>
  	<p>
  		Symmetric Algorithms are what many people assume cryptography is about: two parties have an encryption and decryption method for which they share a secret key. All cryptography from ancient times until 1976 was exclusively based on symmetric methods. Symmetric ciphers are still in widespread use, especially for data encryption and integrity check of messages.
  	</p>
  		<h3>
  			Asymmetric Algorithims
  		</h3>
  		<p>
  			Asymmetric (or Public-Key) Algorithms In 1976 an entirely different type of cipher was introduced by Whitfield Diffie, Martin Hellman and Ralph Merkle. In public-key cryptography, a user possesses a secret key as in symmetric cryptography but also a public key. Asymmetric algorithms can be used for applications such as digital signatures and key establishment, and also for classical data encryption.
  		</p>
  		<h3>
  			Cryptographic protocols
  		</h3>
  		<p>
  			Cryptographic Protocols Roughly speaking, crypto protocols deal with the application of cryptographic algorithms. Symmetric and asymmetric algorithm can be viewed as building blocks with which applications such as secure Internet communication can be realized. The Transport Layer Security (TLS) scheme, which is used in every Web browser, is an example of a cryptographic protocol.
