  		Welcome to to this section where we discuss various techonologies used in cryptography. Today we shall discuss
  		<strong>
  			MD5 
  		</strong> 
      encryption.

  	<h2>
  		MD5 Encryption
  	</h2>
      
      <p>
      <image src=”https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73342312/114277407-bc69ec00-9a33-11eb-9a06-7097e606d1ff.jpg” />
      </p>
  	<p>
  		 The MD5 hashing algorithm is a one-way cryptographic function that accepts a message of any length as input and returns
       as output a fixed-length digest value to be used for authenticating the original message.
       
       The MD5 hash function was originally designed for use as a secure cryptographic hash algorithm for authenticating digital signatures.
       MD5 has been deprecated for uses other than as a non-cryptographic checksum to verify data integrity and detect unintentional data corruption.
  	</p>
  	<h2>
  		How it Works
  	</h2>
    <p>
      The algorithm takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit 'fingerprint' or 'message digest' of the input.
      It is conjectured that it is computationally infeasible to produce two messages having the same message digest, or to produce any message
      having a given pre-specified target message digest. The MD5 algorithm is intended for digital signature applications, where a large file must
      be 'compressed' in a secure manner before being encrypted with a private (secret) key under a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA.
    </p>
    
      
    <p>
  		Cryptography is the science of secret writing with the goal of hiding the meaning of a message. It is associated with the process of converting ordinary plain text into unintelligible text and vice-versa. To achieve this, cyrptography is further split into three main branches: 
  		<em>
  			Symmetric Algorithims, 
  		</em>
  		<em>
  			Asymmetric Algorithims
  		</em>
  		and
  		<em>
  			Cryptographic protocols
  		</em>
  	</p>
  	<h3>
  		Symmetric Algorithims
  	</h3>
  	<p>
  		Symmetric Algorithms are what many people assume cryptography is about: two parties have an encryption and decryption method for which they share a secret key. All cryptography from ancient times until 1976 was exclusively based on symmetric methods. Symmetric ciphers are still in widespread use, especially for data encryption and integrity check of messages.
  	</p>
  		<h3>
  			Asymmetric Algorithims
  		</h3>
  		<p>
  			Asymmetric (or Public-Key) Algorithms In 1976 an entirely different type of cipher was introduced by Whitfield Diffie, Martin Hellman and Ralph Merkle. In public-key cryptography, a user possesses a secret key as in symmetric cryptography but also a public key. Asymmetric algorithms can be used for applications such as digital signatures and key establishment, and also for classical data encryption.
  		</p>
  		<h3>
  			Cryptographic protocols
  		</h3>
  		<p>
  			Cryptographic Protocols Roughly speaking, crypto protocols deal with the application of cryptographic algorithms. Symmetric and asymmetric algorithm can be viewed as building blocks with which applications such as secure Internet communication can be realized. The Transport Layer Security (TLS) scheme, which is used in every Web browser, is an example of a cryptographic protocol.
