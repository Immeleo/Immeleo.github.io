  		5G Technology
  	</h2>
      
  	<p>
  		5G is the fifth generation of wireless technology. But users will know it as one of the fastest, most robust technologies the world has ever seen.

      That means quicker downloads, much lower lag and a significant impact on how we live, work and play.
      The connectivity benefits of 5G are expected to make businesses more efficient and give consumers access to more information faster than ever before.
      Connected cars, smart communities, industrial IoT, immersive education—they all will rely on 5G networks.

        “In the future, everything is going to be transformed by 5G,” says Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg.
        “The pace of technological change in decades past has been fast.
        The only thing we know for sure is that, in the future, it's going to be even faster. 
        We're going to experience a technological shift that will transform people, businesses and society as a whole.”

       Verizon is working tirelessly to roll out 5G on a massive scale. But what exactly is 5G? How does it work? How fast is it,
       really? And how will it change people’s lives? We answer those questions, and more, below.

  		How 5G Works
  	</h2>
    <p>
      <em>
      5G will use ‘massive’ MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) antennas that have very large numbers of antenna elements
      or connections to send and receive more data simultaneously. The benefit to users is that more people can simultaneously
      connect to the network and maintain high throughput.
      The overall physical size of the 5G massive MIMO antennas will be similar to 4G, however with a higher frequency,
      the individual antenna element size is smaller allowing more elements (in excess of 100) in the same physical case.  
      5G User Equipment including mobile phones and devices will also have MIMO antenna technology built into the device for the mmWave frequencies.
